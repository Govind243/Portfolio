                <h3>1.1 Weather and Location Monitoring System</h3>
                   <p>
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an embedded monitoring
system capable of measuring environmental parameters and geographical location
in real time. Sensors were interfaced with a microcontroller to continuously
monitor temperature and humidity, while a GPS module was used to acquire precise

                <h3>1.3 Heart Beat Counter using Pulse Sensor Module</h3>
                 <p>
This project involves the design of a heart rate monitoring system using a pulse
sensor module interfaced with 8051 microcontroller. The sensor detects variations in
blood flow and converts them into electrical signals, which are processed to
calculate the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM).
</p>
<p>
The system was programmed to filter noise, count pulses accurately, and display
the measured heart rate in real time. Through this project, I gained practical
experience in analog signal handling, sensor calibration, embedded data
processing, and basic biomedical instrumentation concepts, making it relevant
for healthcare monitoring and wearable device applications.

                <h3>1.4 Li-Fi Based Data Transmission System</h3>
                <p>
This project demonstrates a Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) based wireless communication
system that uses visible light for data transmission. An LED was used as the
transmitter to modulate digital data, while a photodiode at the receiver end
detected the variations in light intensity and converted them back into electrical
signals.
</p>
<p>
The system highlights the feasibility of using visible light as an alternative to
traditional RF communication, especially in environments where RF interference
is undesirable. This project provided valuable insights into optical wireless
communication, modulation techniques, signal detection, and practical challenges
such as ambient light interference and line-of-sight constraints.

                <h3>2.1 Design and Analysis of 6T SRAM Cell</h3>
                <p>
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a 6-transistor (6T) SRAM cell
using Cadence Virtuoso. The SRAM cell was carefully designed to achieve stable
read and write operations while maintaining low power consumption and reliable
data retention.
</p>
<p>
Detailed analysis was performed to evaluate key performance parameters such as
read stability, write margin, and static noise margin (SNM). Through extensive
simulations, I developed a deeper understanding of CMOS memory design,
device sizing trade-offs, and the impact of transistor parameters on memory
performance, which are critical aspects of modern VLSI design.

                <p>
This project involves the design of a radiation-hardened storage circuit using
Dual Interlocked Storage Cell (DICE) architecture to mitigate the effects of
Single Event Upsets (SEUs). Such effects are common in space and high-radiation
environments where conventional memory cells can suffer data corruption.
</p>
<p>
The DICE-based design ensures improved fault tolerance by maintaining data
integrity even when a node is disturbed by radiation-induced charge. Simulations
were carried out in Cadence Virtuoso to verify robustness and stability under
fault conditions. This project strengthened my understanding of radiation-aware
design, reliability engineering, and advanced memory architectures used in
aerospace and defense applications.
