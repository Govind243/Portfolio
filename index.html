        <!-- ===================== ABOUT ===================== -->
        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong interest in building intelligent, real-world engineering systems. My work lies at the intersection of embedded hardware, wireless communication, VLSI design, artificial intelligence, and cloud technologies, where I focus on transforming theoretical concepts into practical solutions.

I have hands-on experience in embedded systems development, including microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and hardware-software integration. Alongside this, I have a solid foundation in communication engineering, covering RF fundamentals, antennas, wireless channel modeling, and networking concepts, supported by extensive MATLAB-based simulations.
</p>

            <p>
My academic and project experience also extends to VLSI design, where I work with CMOS digital circuits, flip-flops, latches, and radiation-tolerant architectures using industry-standard tools such as Cadence Virtuoso.

To enhance system intelligence, I actively explore AI and machine learning techniques for decision-making, signal analysis, and automation, especially in applications involving embedded and communication systems. I also possess foundational knowledge of cloud computing and web technologies, enabling me to deploy, visualize, and manage data-driven systems effectively.
            </p>    
Overall, I aim to grow as a system-level engineer who can design hardware, understand signals, build reliable circuits, and integrate intelligence and connectivity to create impactful, scalable solutions.

<article class="experience-card">
  <h3>Research Intern – IIIT Delhi (VLC / THz Communication)</h3>
  <p class="duration"><strong>May 2025 – Aug 2025</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Simulated a hybrid Visible Light Communication (VLC) and Terahertz (THz)
      wireless communication system to study high-data-rate indoor transmission
      scenarios, focusing on complementary coverage and reliability offered by
      optical and ultra-high-frequency links.
    </li>

    <li>
      Developed and implemented an Optical Intelligent Reflecting Surface (OIRS)
      model to analyze the impact of receiver Field of View (FOV), incident and
      reflection angles, and orientation randomness, enabling enhanced signal
      redirection and robustness in non-line-of-sight conditions.
    </li>

    <li>
      Evaluated system performance under dynamic indoor environments by
      incorporating human blockage models, user mobility, and random UE
      orientation, and analyzed key performance metrics such as received signal
      strength, SNR, and link reliability through MATLAB-based simulations.
    </li>
